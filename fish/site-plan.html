      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To help others enjoy fishing as much as I do and to provide the necessary information needed to enjoy catching a lot of fish.
        I also want people to get excited about trying new lures or even visiting somewhere new, but knowing what fish you can catch
        and what lures have worked best there. It will also allow others to put in different places that may be good for fishing and
        what lures they used to catch what fish so that others can also spread the word.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone who is interested in learning more about different ways to fish. I try to help people weather they are just old enough to go 
          fishing or if they have fished their whole life and just need a little help learning how to fish for new types of fish.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        We are pro fishing and we want to help every have an enjoyable time on the water fishing, and to learn more about
        how to not get skunked when fishing. When you go fishing at a new place you don't want to leave empty handed.
        A good place to look would be in our locations section that allows you to see what kind of fish are located where.
        After that you can click on the different fish that are shown to be brought to a page that will tell you exactly
        what lure you need to hammer those fish.

        the website and has put in their lucky lure they used.
