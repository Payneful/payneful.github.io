        <p>We are pro fishing and we want to help every have an enjoyable time on the water fishing,
             and to learn more about how to not get skunked when fishing. When you go fishing at a 
             new place you don't want to leave empty handed. A good place to look would be in our 
             locations section that allows you to see what kind of fish are located where. After that
              you can click on the different fish that are shown to be brought to a page that will tell 
              you exactly what lure you need to hammer those fish.</p>
